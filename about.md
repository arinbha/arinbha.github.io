Hello! I'm Arin Bhandari, a CS major focusing on computer systems here at Carnegie Mellon University. My areas of interest are distributed systems, data infrastructure, and applied machine learning.

Some of my past projects include implementing consensus protocols, privacy-preserving networks, and data pipelines. Previously, I interned at Amazon and Palantir, and I will be working at Databricks as a summer software engineering intern.
